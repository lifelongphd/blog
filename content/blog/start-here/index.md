## The Education Scam

The education system is a scam. Let's do some simple math using typical UK figures:

* Undergraduate: £9,000 x (3 years) = £27,000
* Masters = ~£12,000+ (1 year)
* MBA = £25,000-£90,000+ (1 year)

What do all of these courses have in common? 

**1. Time Limited -** This means that when the course ends (or you stop paying) - you stop learning.

**2. Expensive -** An undergraduate degree is the same cost of a deposit on a house.

**3. Learning Materials -** All these courses provide learning in the form of someone reading off some powerpoint slides and telling you to read some recommended books. 

**4. Disconnect with reality -** University learning does not equate to real-world experience - some of the greatest minds and success stories are *not* academics. 

Is that good value? 

Fuck that.

You can teach yourself everything you need to accelerate in your personal and professional life ***for next to nothing.***

## **The New Way to Learn:**

* Average paperback book price: £12
* Average Kindle e-book price: £4.99
* Library subscription: \*\***\*FREE\*\*\***

Let's say for example you wanted the equivalent education of a BA Business Management student or a BSc Computer Science student.

Step 1. Find the course that is most suited to what you would like to learn.

Step 2. Make a list of all the "Recommended Reading" that those students are required to read for each module of that course. (You can get this from any online prospectus on an institution's website).

Step 3. Acquire those books (either paid or free). 

You will have achieved the same education: 

* In less time
* For FREE
* Whilst still earning money in your existing role

Now you may be thinking "But I don't want a University education? Why are you drilling the University thing if you think it's a scam?"

I'm not. Let me explain. 

Universities are ***GREAT*** at curating courses that start you on the ***fundamentals*** of \*any\* topic (typically year 1) and progressing you through to advanced topics (year 3) - so you get an excellent exposure to all aspects of that particular subject. **\*AND\*** because Universities are bound by legal and professional standards, any recommended reading **WILL have been verified as a source** - so you won't be reading false information. 

The ***DOWNSIDE*** to University education is that quite often, incredibly valuable material can be ***ignored*** primarily based on the fact it hasn't been "peer reviewed"

##### ***For example:***

*"How to Win Friends and Influence People"* by Dale Carnegie - is one of the greatest selling books of all time - recommended by top CEO's, psychologists, etc***.*** 

However, will you find it in a University reading list? *Probably not.* I very much doubt it has been "peer reviewed".

The next thing to be aware of is not to discriminate knowledge based on age. 

What do I mean?

Most "new" books are actually just "remixes" of knowledge that has been around for decades or longer. 

That same book - *"How to Win Friends and Influence People"* - was published in 1936 (85 years ago!) and is still **HUGELY** valuable to some of the greatest minds today.

**The bottom line:**

> ***Technology may change, but the fundamentals of life do not.*** 

The aim of this blog is to provide a framework of learning material that exposes you to the **fundamentals** of success and happiness in your **personal and professional life**. 

Good luck - you've got an exciting journey ahead.
